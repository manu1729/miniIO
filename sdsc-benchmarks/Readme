This is a set of simple benchmarks to test Lustre performance for the following cases:
- small I/O operations with many output files (pio-many-files-per-rank.c)
- small I/O operations with one file per rank, but many writes per file (pio-one-file-per-rank.c)
- aggregate I/O with one file per rank (pio-one-file-per-rank-single-write.c)


The following options are provided for each case:
-s <number>: size of each array/variable in KB (is in MB for mpi-io.c)
-b <number>: number of repetitions. This can be used to increase the size of the file being written (doesn't work for the aggreate I/O case).
-p <file path>: path of the output files. Note that this option does not work for pio-many-files-per-rank.c yet.

Note: Change the FILE_PATH in *.h files to point to the lustre file system if required

To test Lustre I/O performance, try combinations of the following, but be cautious if you are using a production system with 
shared I/O nodes.
- change lustre system parameters such as stripe size and stripe count
- vary the number of processes (MPI ranks)
- vary output file sizes

Compile: source build.sh

Example run: mpirun -n 4 ./piov2 -s 10 -b 10
