Using Lustre File System:
--------------------------
- Stripe count and stripe size: set appropriate values of these parameters. 
  For example, a large file might require higher stripe count whereas a smaller file
  may use the default striping (1 or 2).
- Use the benchmarks provided or other benchmarks like IOR to guide the selection of appropriate Lustre
  file tuning parameters (stripe count, stripe size, alignment...)
- Try to avoid using the following commands: ls -l, ls *.out (wildcards)... these commands tend
  to cause excessive network traffic.
- Store only a small number of files per directory. If there is large number of files, try to store
  them in a heirarchical fashion.
- When developing application I/O, try to minimize:
  - frequent file opens/closes.
  - having small I/O operations (reading / writing small chunks multiple times). Instead use
    aggregation and them perform large I/O operation.
- Use tools such as Darshan / TAU to analyze the I/O behavior of your application and then optimize I/O.
  Typical I/O issues mentioned above can be detected using these tools.
